General Nutrition Principles:
A balanced diet includes macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals).
- Protein: Essential for muscle repair and growth. Found in meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and tofu. Recommended intake is about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight.
- Carbohydrates: The body's main source of energy. Choose complex carbs like whole grains, oats, and vegetables over simple carbs like sugar and white bread.
- Fats: Important for hormone production and vitamin absorption. Healthy fats are found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.

Hydration:
- Drink at least 8 glasses (about 2 liters) of water per day. Water is crucial for all bodily functions.

Calorie Guidelines:
- A general guideline for daily calorie intake is 2000 calories for women and 2500 for men, but this varies greatly based on age, activity level, and goals. A deficit of 500 calories per day can lead to about 1 pound of weight loss per week.
