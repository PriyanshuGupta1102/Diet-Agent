DietAI is a smart, conversational AI-powered chatbot designed to be your personal nutrition assistant. It can generate fully personalized 7-day diet plans based on your specific needs, answer general nutrition questions, and can be easily embedded into any existing website with a simple code snippet.

The project follows a modern decoupled architecture, with a powerful FastAPI backend handling the AI logic and a lightweight, dependency-free HTML/CSS/JS widget for the frontend.
